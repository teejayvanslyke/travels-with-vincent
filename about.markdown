Hello! I'm [Teejay VanSlyke](http://teejayvanslyke.com). I started this little
travelblog in August of 2022 when I was about to embark upon another journey in
my custom campervan _Vincent Van Go!_. I built out my van near the start of the
pandemic and traversed the country, finding myself in Saint Petersburg,
Florida.

### Frequently asked questions

#### What's your Instagram?

I don't have one, or any other social media accounts. From my perspective,
travel nowadays has become a consumption-oriented affair. People fritter
from place to place, desperate to show everyone where they've been and to
garner praise in the form of likes and comments. I love blogging because
it's a medium that's purely for my own enjoyment. It's more creative, more
engaging, and more intentional.

You'll find my email address in the footer of this page if you'd like to
reach out! I love sending and receiving emailâ€”it's a slower, more
methodical form of communication.

#### Why are all your photos so ... grainy?

Awhile back, I got rid of my smartphone in favor of a Nokia brick phone.
I find that the experience of moving through the world without
a smartphone more invites mystery, excitement, and attention.

As a result, I no longer had a camera. To remedy this without spending
a fortune, I scoured Craigslist for a cheap used pocket-sized camera. And
so, all the photos on this blog (so far) are taken on a Nikon Coolpix
camera, probably from the early 2000s.
