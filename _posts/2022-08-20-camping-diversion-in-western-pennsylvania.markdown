Unfortunately the loft I rented for a couple nights was booked for the
weekend, so I had to leave Pittsburgh for a few days. I found a state park
forty minutes west of town and reserved a site through Monday.

Here in the woods of Pennsylvania, I'm again confronted by a profound
sense of having returned home. The flora here reminds me of my childhood
in Upstate New York and the disposition of the people here is familiar as
well. So far I've spent the day writing, working out, cooking, and
catching up with my parents on the phone.

The weather forecast calls for rain tomorrow, so I'm a bit apprehensive
about being couped up inside Vincent's belly all day with nowhere to go.
Hopefully the forecast is inaccurate and we'll have some dry hours, but
I probably ought to pack up my camp gear so it's not a soaked mess.

It's been wonderful to have a bit of respite from the city before I return
on Monday. Pittsburgh's suburban landscape doesn't seem nearly as horrid
as St Petersburg'sâ€”I was able to get from the middle of the city to
a rural community in a half hour's drive. I'll always miss Oregon's urban
growth boundary keeping a lid on suburban sprawl; it felt magical to be in
the center of a cosmopolitan city and thirty minutes later feel like
you're in the middle of nowhere.

Tomorrow I'm planning on finding a challenging hike, since I'm starved for
inclines after having been in Florida so long. There are a number of
trails that connect to the campground here, so hopefully I can find my way
to them on foot.

The leaves here are just barely starting to show their colors; the tips of
some of them are yellow, but it'll be a few weeks before they really start
to turn. I'm eager to see the fall colors this year, since I haven't seen
them in the northeast in over a decade.

Here's to hoping I befriend a camper or two tomorrow, since I'm about at
my limit for solitude after a full day alone. We shall see.
