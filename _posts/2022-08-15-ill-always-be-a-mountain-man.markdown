The past few days have illuminated a truth that I think I've known since
I moved to Florida, but that I tried very hard to escape: I'll always be
a mountain man at heart.

This morning I awoke at Black Mountain Campground an hour's drive
northeast of Asheville. The temperature upon waking was a brisk 58 degrees
Fahrenheit and there was a gentle mist lining the treetops. The forest
floor was moist from a combination of the rain during the night and the
morning dew.

I had yet another glorious night's rest—probably the best I've had in
months since the brilliant, dry, cool Florida winter gave way to its
horrid, sticky summertime cousin. Which is a bitter irony, considering
I sleep in a luxurious king-sized pillow-top bed in my apartment, but on
a paltry twin-sized home-made couch conversion in Vincent's belly.

As I made my way through the winding mountain pass back toward Asheville
this morning—with its hairpin switchbacks and crisp air, I giggled with
a feeling of conviction that this is the environment in which I thrive.
Perhaps not Asheville or North Carolina; the south has a political
undercurrent to which I still cannot acclimate. But the mountains,
generally, will always have my heart.

The next couple days I'll be spending in a rented room in West Asheville
so that I can finally take the time to soak up the local culture and
perhaps meet some of the locals. I'm eager to take a shower, to shave my
head, to make a triumphant return to urbanity, at least for a little
while.
