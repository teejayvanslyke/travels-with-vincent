I came to the northeast principally to escape the oppressive Florida heat.
But my other, more consequential reason for coming to the northeast was to
immerse myself in prewar, old-world cities that predated the ubiquity of
the automobile.

Florida (and most of the Sun Belt) is a congested mess of wide-laned
suburban arterial highways, strip malls, parking lots, high urban speed
limits, car culture, trucks the size of tanks, and a general lack of urban
planning. Its infrastructure matured after the Second World War, when the
general consensus (read: propagandized consensus) was that every American
should own a single-family detached house and an automobile.

As a result, southern cities, excepting their prewar urban cores, are
a car-infested nightmare. They're hostile to anyone who isn't driving
a car, and most people in these places see pedestrians and cyclists as
a nuissance. Which is an irony, since I can't think of a bigger nuissance
than loud, polluting automobiles bisecting every single facet of civic
life.

But here in Pittsburgh, founded in the decades before the Revolutionary
War, the city wasn't designed with cars in mind. Cars didn't even exist.
As a result, blocks are smaller and denser, streets are narrower, and
communities are more integrated.

Just take a look at this photo I took of the back patios of the rowhouses
here in Lawrenceville:

One cannot help but know their neighbors if they're right beside them
every time they go outside. And this might be subjective, but to me this
is more beautiful and inviting than a big suburban backyard with a fence.
It has a sense of place, character, charm. Stuff happened here.

And that's not to say there aren't cars in Pittsburgh. Actually, as
a result of higher density and a transit system that's evidently
underused, there's actually a ton of car traffic on these tiny streets.
But because of the fact the streets are so narrow, cars have no choice but
to drive slowly, lest they side-swipe parked cars in the parking lanes. To
me this is representative of the pervasive nature of car culture in
America. The idea that you'd drive a private automobile living in
Lawrenceville, to me, is insane. Everything you need is within walking
distance, and there's reliable bus service on Butler Street. But I imagine
many people have car-brain and cannot imagine not driving their F-150 down
a tiny eighteenth century alleyway and trying to find parking.

This is in contrast to cities in the Sun Belt, where not owning a car is
almost impossible unless you happen to live in the small prewar urban
cores. I happen to live in a prewar area of St Petersburg, and can
accomplish most things by foot. But the sheer lack of density precludes
say, a small corner grocery store ever emerging in my neighborhood. There
just aren't enough people within walking distance to make it economically
viable.

To me, Lawrenceville is an example we could follow if we want to start
building more environmentally sustainable and economically equitable
communities in the United States. Like most prewar neighborhoods, the
rents in Lawrenceville have ballooned in recent years. People want to live
in walkable neighborhoods, yet we continue to build unsustainable suburban
hellscapes. This is a result of terrible policy, since it would be illegal
to build another Lawrenceville in most places in America due to
single-family zoning.

When considering how to mitigate climate change, how to provide equitable
transportation options, and how to build more integrated communities,
let's look toward the past to get to the future.

Also, isn't this just so much more beautiful than the bland suburban
housing that gets built today?
