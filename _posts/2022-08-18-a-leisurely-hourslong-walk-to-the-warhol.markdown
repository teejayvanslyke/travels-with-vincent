I returned to the loft after my morning coffee and writing to shed the
clothes I'd donned in the chilly, overcast morning and prepare for my
journey down the river to the Warhol Museum.

I began walking toward downtown on Butler Street and my stomach rumbled.
I came across a homegrown breakfast place several blocks into the walk and
so I popped in for a bite. 

The thing that strikes me most about Pittsburgh is its colonial influence
in the architecture. Pittsburgh was founded before the Revolutionary War,
and so it's a wonderland of diverse architectural styles reaching all the
way back to the time of British rule. It's wild stuff to spend time in
a place with so much history.

I walked through the Strip District, which felt like a strange combination
of tourist junk shops and warehouses. There I asked a couple locals for
directions, and they told me I could walk down to the river where there
was a multi-use path.

The banks of the Alleghany are lush with greenery and the infrastructure
is haunting and historic. Again, you get the sense here that real stuff
happened.

Eventually, I reached the Three Sisters, of which one is named after Andy
Warhol. I walked up the stairs from the river path and found myself
suspended above the river. And suddenly, the museum's signage could be
seen in the distance on the north banks.

Here are some shots from inside the museum:

I walked back over the bridge into downtown, and caught the 91 bus back to
Lawrenceville.
