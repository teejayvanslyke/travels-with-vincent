I sauntered home from Haywood Rd and made a turkey sandwich inside
Vincent's belly. I love having the ability to prepare my own food on the
go—it's a delight that I haven't been able to enjoy in so long!

Once I ate my "brunch", I packed up my things and headed eastward toward
downtown Asheville. My first stop was the Moogseum, a museum chronicling
the life and work of Robert Moog.

As I approached the door, a transient woman was stumbling down the
sidewalk screaming at the sky. Cursing in every direction, she violently
struck down the A board outside the museum. I shrugged it off and went
inside.

The clerk appeared, greeted me, and explained she needed to go take care
of the A board that had fallen at the hands of the screaming woman.
I waited for her at the counter and she came back, explaining how that
sort of thing happens all the time. I reassured her that I was used to
dealing with that sort of thing as well. We meandered on and on in
a lovely conversation about our travels, Asheville, culture, and the like.

To me, the most profound part of travel is meeting new people and sharing
meaningful conversation together. I've noticed that southerners are
especially open to conversing with strangers and don't have the
guardedness that tends to pervade northwesterners. In just a couple days
being in Asheville I've had the pleasure of finding myself in several
fantastic conversations.

Once I perused the Moogseum and played a theramin (they unfortunately
didn't permit photography inside), I wandered to a nearby coffee shop
called Rowan:

The interior of Rowan reminded me instantly of Barista, a small chain of
cafes in Portland, Oregon. The crown moulding, retro fixtures, and fine
woodworking gave me an instant feeling of nostalgia for my time in the
northwest. And, unsurprisingly, they served coffee roasted by Heart
Roasters in Portland.

After sitting and doing a bit of writing, I decided to try to find
Malaprop's Books, a small bookstore cafe I'd read was worth seeing.
I headed to Vincent and entered "malaprop" into his GPS, driving away from
my parking spot. But then I realized it was walking distance from where
I was, and there was hardly any chance of finding another parking spot.

Downtown Asheville, while breathtakingly beautiful and charming, is
incredibly stressful, both on foot and by car. It feels like a place that
was once modest, but then became gentrified as people discovered it as
a mountain refuge. It has to me the same feeling of retrofitted
gentrification as Portland. And with that, it seems, comes bands of roving
tourists feverishly driving cars with out-of-state plates... myself
included.

I retreated back to West Asheville for the afternoon—a place that feels
more local, less contrived, less touristy, calmer, more real.
