There are only a few short days until I head northward from my home base
in Saint Petersburg, Florida all the way to Montreal.

I'm very eager to get out of Florida and see some different landscapes and
interact with different cultures, even if I'll only be traversing North
America. I was stunned by how different Florida was when I arrived, and it
will be equally as stunning I'm sure to once again witness the North
through Southern eyes.

I'm so grateful for the friends I've made during my time in St Pete. I'm
not sure I've ever been a member of such a dynamic group.

Because I kicked my smartphone to the curb, I'll be taking photos on the
trip with a Nikon Coolpix camera I bought from Craigslist for $20. As you
can see from the image above, it's of _excellent_ quality!

Check back here for updates as I traverse this wild continent!
