There are a lot of reasons I'm eager to leave Florida. A place that could
have had so much potential for functional, beautiful urbanism has been
perverted into a horrid landscape of strip malls, four-lane high-speed
roads lined with "PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY" placards honoring road casualties,
intense poverty juxtaposed against intense affluence, and a brand of
American exceptionalism politics on overdrive. I left Oregon because
I thought I wasn't progressive enough for it; Florida has reinvigorated my
progressivism in a way I never thought possible. 

But then again, I've had some of the most positive experiences of my life
here. I've made more friends in my yearlong tenure here in Saint
Petersburg than I ever made in Portland or Seattle. And those friendships
have been deeper, stronger, and more resilient.
