Yesterday I breathed a sigh of relief as I returned to civilization and
could finally take a proper shower again. I spent some time at my new
digs—a basement apartment a few blocks off Haywood Rd—before venturing up
the hill to do some flâneuring along Haywood.

West Asheville reminds me a bit of Seattle and a bit of Portland. It's
gritty, derelict, and industrial. There's a unique mix of old-world shops
and new-world gentrification.

I stumbled upon another kava bar after having spent the afternoon across
town at Sovereign Kava. Elevated Kava Lounge is situated on the upper
level of an old brick building on Haywood.

This morning I woke up and originally intended to find a cafe called
Izzy's that I had read about the day before, but my desperation for
caffeine was too mighty for me to find it. So I settled for a quaint
coffee shop called Bean Werks just a couple blocks down from Elevated
Kava.

When I travel, I love to notice subtle differences between the place
I came from and the place I am. The thing I notice here compared to in St
Pete is that people are a bit more earthy. That's not to say I haven't
met my fair share of earthy folk in St Pete, but there's a mountain town
feeling here that reminds me a bit of the Pacific Northwest.

Today I'm hoping to make my way to the Moogseum—the Moog synthesizer
museum downtown. And there's a bookstore I've heard is worth visiting as
well.
