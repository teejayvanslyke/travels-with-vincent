_Pardon my French, haux haux haux... I'm trying to learn as much as I can
while I'm here. The title of this post translates to "A pedestrian
paradise"._

At risk of sounding like a broken record: Why do we build cities like we
do in the United States, when there's _clearly_ a better way? I came to
Montréal to discover whether my suspicions were correct—that there could
be a city somewhere in North America where the automobile wasn't the
highest priority citizen. Even in "progressive" Portland, life without
a car was tenuous at best due to most of the city being filled with
single-family housing. And Manhattan has the opposite problem: Skyscrapers
suffocate the island with hoardes of pedestrians on every streetcorner.

But here in Montréal, life is so pleasant on foot. I walked around in awe
at how much I could access on my own two feet. I walked by several
supermarkets, some ethnic and some organic. Shops of every stripe. Cafes,
bars, restaurants. Parks and playgrounds. And despite the density,
I haven't once felt overwhelmed. In fact, I've felt more comfortable than
I ever do in America, because I haven't been steering a two-ton hunk of
glass and metal through a goddamn city.

There are several streets in the central city that close traffic to
private automobiles, such as the one pictured above. Walking down these is
like being in an urban wonderland. It's quiet. It's charming. There's
a real sense of place. You're free to stop and enjoy yourself without the
threat of being run over.

I will never stop asking: Why don't we do this in America? Why do we
choose to live our lives confined to horrid glass and metal boxes
careening dangerously through asphalt-laden hellscape cities, when there's
clearly a more livable way? I'm here, I'm experiencing it, and it's so
much better. Not only is it better, but it's also, per capita, much more
efficient and economical.

I've had a few incredible multilingual experiences here so far. Yesterday,
I came across a Latin supermarket, where I bought some pastries,
a baguette, and some chorizo to prepare at home. The clerk didn't speak
any English. I didn't speak any French, but I could tell she spoke a bit
of Spanish. So I used the few Spanish phrases I knew to hopefully convey
the transaction. It barely worked and we both kept laughing at each other.

Now I'm sitting at an Italian-owned cafe. I walked in, and, armed with
a bit more French, asked "Parlez-vous anglais?" The barista seemed a bit
confused, and just asked "English?" I couldn't tell what her native
language was, but a couple of the regulars spent the next fifteen minutes
conversing, switching back and forth between Italian and English.

All of this is making me realize how much more rich life would be if
I were multilingual, and I'm going to make it a priority to learn French
from now on, since I'm sure I would enjoy my time here even more if
I weren't timid on account of the language barrier.

I'll leave you today with an interesting quirk I've seen here. There are
still quite a few payphones strewn about the city—I wonder if these are
kept in operation for those people who cannot afford cell phones. Anyway,
being a bit of a telephony nerd, I couldn't help but snap a picture:
